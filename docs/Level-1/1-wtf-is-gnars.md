#  WTF is Gnars? 

Gnars is a community that supports extreme sports athletes, such as surfers, skateboarders, skiers, and skydivers. If you create content about these activities and seek support, this community is for you! Gnars is revolutionizing how these activities are supported. Instead of relying on traditional sponsors, Gnars uses an innovative system of collective funding, where anyone can contribute.

Gnars has created an ecosystem where people can buy "Gnars," unique digital representations (like collectible digital stickers). The money from these sales goes into a fund that helps cover athletes' expenses. This business model is collaborative, inclusive, collective, and transparent, ensuring everyone has a voice and participation.

Gnars not only supports athletes financially but also promotes extreme sports on a larger scale, bringing more visibility and opportunities to athletes worldwide.

### How It Works

- **Buying and Selling**: People buy these digital "Gnars" in auctions.
- **Collective Fund**: The money raised is put into a common fund.
- **Collective Decisions**: Those who own a "Gnar" can vote on how the money is spent to support athletes and projects.
